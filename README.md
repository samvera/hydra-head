# What is Hydra-Head?

Hydra-Head is a Ruby-on-Rails gem containing the core code for a web
application using the full stack of Samvera building blocks.

## Product Owner & Maintenance

`hydra-head` was a Core Component of the Samvera Community. Given a decline in available labor required for maintenance, this project no longer has a dedicated Product Owner. The documentation for what this means can be found [here](http://samvera.github.io/core_components.html#requirements-for-a-core-component).

### Product Owner

**Vacant**

_Until a Product Owner has been identified, we ask that you please direct all requests for support, bug reports, and general questions to the [`#dev` Channel on the Samvera Slack](https://samvera.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=dev)._

## Installation/Setup

### Installation Prerequisites

See the [Installation Prerequisites](http://github.com/samvera/hydra-head/wiki/Installation-Prerequisites) wiki page.

Ruby 2.1.0+ is required by Hydra-Head release 10+; RVM is strongly suggested.

### Install Rails

    gem install 'rails' --version '~>5.1.0'

### Generate a new rails application:

    rails new my_hydra_head
    cd my_hydra_head

### Install Dependencies

First, add them to the [Gemfile](http://gembundler.com/gemfile.html) of
your application. The new rails application you just generated will have
generated a Gemfile; add blacklight and hydra-head as below:

      source 'https://rubygems.org'

      gem 'rails'
      gem 'blacklight'
      gem 'hydra-head', '~> 10.0'

To install all of the dependencies, run:

    bundle install


### Run the generators and migrations:

Run the blacklight generator

    rails g blacklight:install --devise

Run the hydra-head generator

    rails g hydra:head -f

Run the database migrations

    rake db:migrate
